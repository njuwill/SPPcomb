## Package Introduction

This is the R package code for **A New Estimation Approach for Combining Epidemiological Data From Multiple Sources**. In this project, we propose a novel two-step procedure to combine epidemiological data obtained from diverse sources with the aim to quantify risk factors affecting the probability that an individual develops certain disease such as cancer.
